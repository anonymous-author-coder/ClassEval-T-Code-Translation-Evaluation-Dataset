# How to Use the Testing Program

**Note:** This program has significant limitations; please make sure to operate it within the IDEA environment.

## Steps to Operate

### Step 1
First, disable warning notifications to ensure only error messages are displayed. This will improve the accuracy of our test verification.

### Step 2
When moving code generated by the large language model to a folder, we often need to add `package org.example;`. We can automate this for all code in the specified folder using a script, which improves efficiency.

### Step 3: autotest1
This operates through screen and keyboard input. Since IDEA can open up to 100 tabs, please add 50 pieces of code at a time, with each “solution” paired with a “test.” Each run will automatically close the current tab (`Ctrl+F4`).

### Step 4: autotest2
`autotest1` saves images and text in the output folder. Simply direct the program to the relevant output file. The `source_folder` is where you extract code (i.e., code generated by the large model), and the `target_folder` is where you save the code.

### Step 5
From here, we can use IDEA’s JUnit to conduct cluster tests and output the results. To prevent inaccuracies in machine detection, screenshots of failed tests are saved, ensuring accuracy and safeguarding against false negatives due to missing dependencies.

### Step 6
This process is complex, so after each run of `autotest2`, make sure to save all files in the `output` folder and then clear the folder to prevent any data from contaminating the next test.

## Testing Procedure

Our testing mainly relies on mimicking manual testing procedures, allowing the machine to handle parts of the process. For example, checking for error messages helps us verify if the program can run successfully. To improve accuracy, we employ dual criteria: color recognition (for issues) and text presence detection in specified areas (for error messages).

If there are no red pixels and no error messages, the program automatically logs the name of the file (ensuring you start with a class name) in a text file. Then, running `autotest2` moves the records from the text document to a designated folder for further testing.

**Note:**  
For the coordinates provided by `autotest1`, you can use code `c` to determine their location. Please provide coordinates that are as precise and narrow as possible (especially in terms of pixels), as wider ranges greatly reduce accuracy.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Java 8 or higher
- Large Language Model API (ensure the API key is configured before running tests)
